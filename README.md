# Diagnostics

A collection of diagnostic bits and pieces for Elixir. 

Examples: 

Get module name from pid
```elixir
Diagnostics.module_name(pid)
```

Get the size of a process
```elixir
Diagnostics.size(pid)
```

Get the size of processes state
```elixir
Diagnostics.state_size(pid)
```

Get a processes state
```elixir
Diagnostics.state(pid)
```

List the processes in the system using the most memory (total heap) by module name and the count of them running on the node
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_module
```

List all processes created by Module MyModule in namespace MyApp ordered by size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_size("MyApp.MyModule")
```

List top 10 processes created by Module MyModule in namespace MyApp ordered by size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_size("MyApp.MyModule", 10)
```

List all processes ordered by size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_size
```

List all processes created by Module MyModule in namespace MyApp ordered by proc bin size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_large_binary_size("MyApp.MyModule")
```

List top 10 processes created by Module MyModule in namespace MyApp ordered by proc bin size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_large_binary_size("MyApp.MyModule", 10)
```

List all processes ordered by proc bin size
```elixir
Diagnostics.processes_by_large_binary_size
```

These can also be run on a remote node e.g 

```elixir 
:rpc.call(@node_name, Diagnostics, :module_name, [pid])
```
